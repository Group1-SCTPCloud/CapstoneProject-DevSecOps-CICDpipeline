## CICD Pipeline


--------------------------------------
Julian's draft that we can incorporate into the write up above. 


Create New Project 
Create 2 new repositories on GitHub and assign appropriate access to the group members as collaborators based on their role.
Web application repository 
Backend AWS configuration repository

Create Static Web Application (S3) 
Create 2 versions of a static website to be hosted on S3 to simulate a working CD pipeline

Application is deployed to AWS.

Write CD pipeline
A CD script should be written with Github actions The static webpages can be built, tests can be run, and the application can be deployed using the CD script. 

Proper authentication and authorization are to be ensured in each environment in the CD Script, with the condition that credentials used for deploying development and production environments should not be the same.

Proper handling of CICD Pipeline Secrets is to be carried out.

-  Master Branch is secured
-  Work with Pull Request & Merging
-  Create new Role on AWS and use the secret into Github, Not User
-  Get Key from AWS

Write the Terraform script to be used in the CD pipeline.
- Create a S3 bucket for storage of Terraform state
-  Ensure that the .tf state file is stored remotely in a S3 bucket
-  Terraform script should replace the old version of the static website within the same bucket.
